Portfolio â€” November 2019 (_nology)

During the last three weeks of the course, we were tasked to build our portfolios with some basic common components such as a bio, features of our work, and a contact form. 

On my portfolio, you can find all of these along with previews of my blog posts from LinkedIn, a preview of my CV, and also a link to download it.
